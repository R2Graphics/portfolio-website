        <p>Justin is a Psychologist who was looking for an updated business card.
          This was his original (see figure1 below)</p>

        <h5>figure1</h5>
        <picture srcset="img/projects/jason_business_card/original_bc.png">

        <p>At first the client wanted to go for a more abstract look, so I began
          with using Adobe Illustrator. He showed me a different card I had created
          for a client of his, and asked me to design something similar (see figure2 below). </p>

        <h5>figure2</h5>
        <picture srcset="img/projects/jason_business_card/mordys_card/mordys_card_front_640.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/projects/jason_business_card/mordys_card/mordys_card_front_1200" alt="Inspiration Card">

        <p>After I created some looks in Illustrator, based on the Jason's brief,
          he didn't really like any of the samples.

        <p>He then realized he wanted something that looked more realistic and natural.
          He wanted the card to portray an oasis of calmness and serenity.
          The image of the Cliffs of Moher specifically spoke to him (see figure3 below).</p>

        <h5>figure3</h5>
        <picture srcset="img/projects/jason_business_card/cliffs/cliffs_640.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/projects/jason_business_card/cliffs/cliffs_1200.jpg" alt="Cliffs of Moher">

        <p> I then switched programs to Adobe Photoshop, so I could use the image.
          I used this information to create a visual business card that would
          portray natural and organic, while appealing to the strengths of his
          clients, rather than their intellect. I sent the client many variations of the
          card and he chose the one he liked best. The overall process took
          2-3 months because the client lacked the motivation to follow up,
          and he kept changing his mind for what the overall outcome should be.</p>
